# üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶NURTURE 
<i> The easiest way to help tutors engage with students and guide their progress. </i>

## BACKGROUND
Nurture was an idea that sprung from my days as an English tutor, where I would often set homework for my students and ask them to deliver it in a format other than an essay, for e.g: in a live presentation format or recording themselves on video visually explaining the homework. I wanted to create a platform which helped to bring students together in a peer-to-peer learning effort (to gain inspiration from each other), while getting them to exercise their creativity skills in an approach similar to social media (e.g: Instagram). 

Our lead dev Shunjiro also had a real life tennis tutor friend that was having difficulty in maintaining records for his students, especially because all their feedback was written on paper forms. He really needed a way to properly maintain all feedback, visually see the data on his students lesson improvement over time, and communicate with his students one-on-one. 

Hence Nurture was created to bring those two ideas together on one platform, with a primary focus for helping tennis tutors teach their students more effectively by seeing their progress on a chart and allocating more homework in the areas they were struggling.

## ROLES
* I took on project management duties and was responsible for developing the presentation, 
* Shunjiro as lead dev took on all the duties for Heroku pushes, repairing the auto-mailer, code quality, and fixing clashes as they came. 
* James was our lead back-end dev, as well as creating and maintaining the 1-on-1 chatbox, 
* while Shingo was responsible for all things front end. 

Everyone did a marvellous job and without their hard work and effort, this project would not have been possible. All our success is because of them.

## DEVELOPMENT
* We started by planning our user's journey from start to finish on a simple spreadsheet. As there were 2 users (student and teacher) we had to chart out both journeys and their corresponding CRUD paths.
* We then used Figma to draw a mockup of the progression from page to page and what the users would interact with. 
* Finally we got our Heroku and Trello up and running, so that we could track our progress and remind ourselves about what was due everyday. 

My goal here was to make sure that everybody knew what their tasks were everyday, and there was no confusion about what was to be done.

## BACK-END
* Rails was the back-end skeleton using the MVC model and we made sure to include some quality seeds for all our students and tutors, especially because we wanted to show the process from start to finish

## FRONT-END
* Shingo did a marvellous job in creating a quality layout using a nice dashboard from bootstrap. He also made sure to include a sticky navbar and turned our boring tables into interesting cards for the user to interact with. His goal here was to ensure that the user only filled in data when he needed it, and the rest of the time was all to make sure that the tutor/student could see everything they needed to on one page, as opposed to just clicking again and again to reach another page.
