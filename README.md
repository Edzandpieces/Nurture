# üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶NURTURE 
<i> The easiest way to help tutors engage with students and guide their progress. </i>

## Background
Nurture was an idea that sprung from my days as an English tutor, where I would often set homework for my students and ask them to deliver it in a format other than an essay, for e.g: in a live presentation format or recording themselves on video visually explaining the homework. I wanted to create a platform which helped to bring students together in a peer-to-peer learning effort (to gain inspiration from each other), while getting them to exercise their creativity skills in an approach similar to social media (e.g: Instagram). 

Our lead dev Shunjiro also had a real life tennis tutor friend that was having difficulty in maintaining records for his students, especially because all their feedback was written on paper forms. He really needed a way to properly maintain all feedback, visually see the data on his students lesson improvement over time, and communicate with his students one-on-one. 

Hence Nurture was created to bring those two ideas together on one platform, with a primary focus for helping tennis tutors teach their students more effectively by seeing their progress on a chart and allocating more homework in the areas they were struggling.
